An application of a consistent estimator for a classification model with misclassified data.

## Background

I learned of this dataset from a Lunch-n-Learn session
of the
Orlando Machine Learning and Data Science (OMLDS) group. 
Information about the session is available on 
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com)
at 
[2023 Lunch n'Learn - End to End Machine Learning Challenge](https://www.meetup.com/orlando-mlds/events/296542199/).

The group also participates in a [Discord group
for the Lunch-n-Learn sessions](https://discord.com/channels/688989239773233213/802286971087093780).


## Data

The dataset consists of observations of instances of fraud
from a dataset prepared for a Kaggle competition
called
[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/).
